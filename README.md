# trojan_keylog
>this trojan has inspiration from dunglailaptrinh.

# how it works
>This python code is written to transform the letters from the keyboard while you type and save it to "log.txt" as a text file

***note:***\
    ***key.enter is '\n'***\
    ***key.tab is '    '*** \
    ***key.space is ' '*** \
>It can run in the background while you open a browser, for example, chrome, edge,... 

# how to use
1. Copy or download `'code.py'` then change `'code.py'` to `'code.pyw'` ***because*** a '.pyw' file is a python script file extension, indicating that, a script needs to be run using PYTHONW. EXE instead of PYTHON. EXE in Window. To sum up, if you need to run a script in the background in Windows, without displaying a dos console from popping up, you give the extension '.pyw'.
2. Download `'browser.bat'`. 
3. Right-click to `'browser.bat'` then choose `edit` (you can edit it by any text app, for example, sublime text, notepad, notepad++,...).
4. As you can see, I set the default location of my browser is ***EDGE***, so you can edit it with your location of any browsers you want to! (you can see how to get the location of any file in the next part). For convenience, you move `'code.pyw'` to the same location with the browser you want to add it. Then, change 2 location in `browser.bat` into 2 your location of your browser and your `code.pyw` .
5. Copy the shortcut of that browser to desktop or move it to the taskbar if you want.
6. press 'Esc' on your keyboard if you want to stop that trojan!

# what is 'browser.bat'

`'browser.bat'` is a file that runs as the command in window, it can open browser you add in and 'trojan_keylog' at the same time. Besides that, 'trojan_keylog' run in the background and no one cannot relise it except for ***task manager***.
