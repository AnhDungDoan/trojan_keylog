# trojan_keylog
>this trojan has inspiration from dunglailaptrinh.

# how it works
>This python code is written to change all key from the keyboard while you press(on_press) to text and save it to "log.txt" as a text

***note:***

  ***key.enter is '\n'***
  
  ***key.tab is '    '***
  
  ***key.space is ' '***

>It can run in the background while you open a browser, for example, chrome, edge, ... if you change the file location of that browser to the location you download file 'browser.bat'

# what is 'browser.bat'

`'browser.bat'` is a file that runs as the command in window, it can open both browser you add in and 'trojan_keylog', besides that, 'trojan_keylog' run in the background and anyone cannot detect it except using ***task manager***

# how to use
1. Copy or download code.py then change `'code.py'` to `'code.pyw'` ***because*** a '.pyw' file is a python script file extension, indicating that, a script needs to be run using PYTHONW. EXE instead of PYTHON. EXE in Window. To sum up, if you need to run a script in the background in Windows, without displaying a dos console from popping up, you give the extension '.pyw'.
